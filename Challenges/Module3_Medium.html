    HTML Element Structure 
    Congratulations on completing the first challenge! 
    Now, let's move on to the next level, where we'll focus on the element structure in HTML. 
    Your task is to create a webpage with specific elements and attributes. Here are the details:
    
    1. Start with a new HTML file and set up the basic structure.  
    2. Create a <header> element and include a heading that says "My Website." 
    3. Inside the header, add a navigation menu with three links: "Home," "About," and "Contact." 
    4. Create a main content section using the <main> element.  
    5. Within the main content, add a section with an id of "about" and include a heading that says "About Me."  
    6. Write a paragraph describing your hobbies and interests. 
    7. Below the "about" section, add another section with an id of "contact" and a heading that says "Contact Me."  
    8. Insert a form with fields for name, email, and a submit button.  
    9. Make sure to use appropriate HTML elements and attributes to structure your content effectively. Best of luck!
