    Module 3 | Hard Challenge
    Bravo on conquering the previous challenges! 
    Now, it's time to tackle a more advanced task involving HTML headings, paragraphs, formatting, quotations, and comments. 
    Here's what you need to do:
    1. Create a new HTML file and set up the basic structure. 
    2. Inside the <body> tag, insert a <header> element with a heading that says "My Blog." 
    3. Below the header, create a <main> element and divide it into two columns.  
    4. In the left column, add a section with a heading that says "Latest Post."  
    5. Within this section, write a blog post using appropriate headings and paragraphs. 
    6. Format the blog post by adding bold and italicized text, as well as an unordered list with three items.
    7. In the right column, add a section with a heading that says "Quote of the Day."  
    8. Include a meaningful quote using the <blockquote> and <q> tags. 
    9. Finally, add comments throughout your HTML code to explain the purpose of each section and element. 
    10. Remember, attention to detail is key in this challenge. Aim for clean and well-structured HTML code.

                <h3>My Journey into Web Development</h3>
                <p>
                    After years of working in a different field, I decided to pursue my passion for web development. 
                    It has been an exciting journey filled with challenges and learning opportunities.

                <h3>Exploring the World of HTML</h3>
                <p>
                    <b>HTML</b> is the foundation of <i>the web</i>, and understanding its structure and elements is crucial for any web developer. 
                    I have enjoyed learning about tags, attributes, and best practices for creating accessible and well-structured websites.
                    Here are a few key points I've learned so far:
                </p>
                <!-- Unorderd list -->
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.</li>
                    <li>Tags are used to define the structure of a webpage.</li>
                    <li>Attributes provide additional information about elements.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <!-- Right column for Quote of the Day -->
            <section>
                <h2>Quote of the day</h2>
                <!-- Blockquote with citation -->
                <blockquote>
                    <p>“The only way to do great work is to love what you do.”</p>
                    <footer>- Steve Jobs</footer>
                </blockquote>
            </section>
        </main>
    </body>
