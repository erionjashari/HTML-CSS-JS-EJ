<!-- Module 8 Hard Challenge
Advanced SVG and Multi-pages with Navigation 

Great job on your progress! 
Now, let's take on a more challenging task involving advanced SVG graphics and a multi-page website with navigation. 
We'll create an interactive data visualization page with multiple sections. Here are the instructions:
    1. Create a new HTML file (index.html) as the main page. 
    2. Set up the basic structure of the HTML document using appropriate tags. 
    3. Add a title to your document using the <title> tag. 
    4. Implement a navigation bar with links to different sections of the page (e.g., "Home," "Data Visualization," "Contact"). 
    5. Create multiple sections on the page using appropriate semantic tags (e.g., <section>). 
    6. In the "Data Visualization" section, insert an advanced SVG graphic displaying a chart or graph of your choice. Customize the SVG with various shapes and attributes to make it visually appealing and informative. 
    7. Add a contact form in the "Contact" section with input fields for name, email, and message. Use appropriate HTML form elements and attributes for validation. 
    8. Ensure that each link in the navigation bar takes users to the corresponding section of the page using anchor links (<a> with href="#section-id"). -->
