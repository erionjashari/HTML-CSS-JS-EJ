    HTML New Elements and Semantics 
    Congratulations on completing the first challenge! Now, 
    let's level up our HTML skills by incorporating new elements and using semantic tags. 
    Your task is to create a webpage that showcases a list of your favorite books. 
    Here are the instructions: 

    1. Start with a new HTML file and set up the basic structure. 
    2. Add a title to your document using the <title> tag. 
    3. Insert a heading that says "My Favorite Books" using appropriate heading tags. 
    4. Create a <main> element and divide it into sections using semantic tags. 
    5. In the first section, create an ordered list (<ol>) to display the book titles. 
    6. Include at least five book titles as list items (<li>).
    7. Add a <figure> element for each book. Inside the <figure>, 
    include an image of the book and a <figcaption> with the book's title. 
    8. In the second section, create an unordered list (<ul>) to list the authors' names. 
    9. Add at least five author names as list items (<li>).
