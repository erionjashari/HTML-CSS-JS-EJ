This repo houses my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
This is the code I learn in write while enrolled in this Digital School Corse.


Here is the typical convention that I use when writing HTML:

Tags that contain less information (like headers) are not indented.

Tags that contain larger information (like paragraphs) are indented.

I also indent major tags and tages that are contained in tages (like the html tag, the head tag, the body tag, and others)

I also add a multi-line comments at the top of my code, usually used for intructions and importent information.
These multi-line comments are used a lot in the Module Challenges, usually containing the intructions for the challenge.

Thank You for Reading,
